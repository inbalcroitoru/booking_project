Given hotel internet reviews, which consist of a positive part and a negative part,
each part of the review will be labeled whether any of the following topics are discussed: price, hotel location, hotel rooms, food, facilities and hotel staff.

The code performs the labeling using fine-tuned Bret which was trained on reviews from Booking.com.
The file should be in CSV format and its path should be specified when calling the main function.
In addition, if this is the first time you are running the code, you should change the variable first_time to True.
