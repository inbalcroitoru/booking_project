= Topic Modeling for Hotel Reviews

Special packages to install:
  -gdown
  -transformers


Given hotel internet reviews, which consist of a positive part and a negative part,
each part of the review will be labeled whether any of the following topics are discussed: price, hotel location, hotel rooms, food, facilities and hotel staff.

The code performs the labeling using fine-tuned Bert which was trained on reviews from Booking.com. (you can run it with cpu or gpu)
The file should be in CSV format and its path should be specified when calling the main function.
In addition, if this it is the first time you are running the code, you should change the variable first_time to True, so the trained model would be saved locally (after the first time change the variable to False).

The output file would be save in the same directory under the name "labeled_"+file_path (as file_path is the original file path)
